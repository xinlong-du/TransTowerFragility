# Event-based collapse fragility development for transmission towers subjected to hurricanes

This repository contains sample OpenSees simulation cases used in the work of [1]. The repository describes the step-by-step procedure to run a successful incremental dynamic analysis for transmission towers subjected to a suite of hurricane wind speed and direction records. The transmission tower is modeled using the displacement-based beam element developed in the work of [2]. Users can compile and use the customized OpenSees in the repo [xinlong-du/OpenSees-3.0.0](https://github.com/xinlong-du/OpenSees-3.0.0), or use the official OpenSees with changing the element name "dispBeamColumn" in this repo to "dispBeamColumnAsym" and follow the [documentation](https://opensees.github.io/OpenSeesDocumentation/user/manual/model/elements/dispBeamColumnAsym.html).
